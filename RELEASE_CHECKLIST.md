# Release Checklist

Copy this checklist for each new version. Every box starts open; a previous release or local dry-run does not satisfy the next one. Record the exact version, source SHA, and proof URLs below, then follow [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).

- Target version and tag: candidate `0.3.0` / `v0.3.0`; not tagged or published
- Source commit: _pending_
- CI, compatibility, CodeQL, and Scorecard runs: _pending_
- Container digest and Action integration run, if announced: _pending_
- Public PyPI and GitHub Release URLs: _pending_

## Product and Documentation

- [ ] Runtime version, signed tag, wheel metadata, changelog, and release name match.
- [ ] README installation commands and badges are live and honest.
- [ ] Compatibility policy names only combinations with visible required checks.
- [ ] Security, support, contribution, and migration guidance is current.
- [ ] Notes link the exact recipes, compatibility run, before/after evidence, and user problems improved.
- [ ] External issue reporters, recipe authors, testers, and code contributors are credited by their requested name or anonymously.

## Automated Evidence

- [ ] Ruff, formatting, mypy, fast tests, and the 80% full-suite coverage gate pass.
- [ ] Python 3.10–3.14 package matrix passes.
- [ ] The same prebuilt wheel passes media smoke tests on Linux, macOS, and Windows with Python 3.10 and 3.14.
- [ ] Cold deterministic fixtures pass without cache reuse.
- [ ] `twine check`, wheel contents, sdist contents, and clean isolated installation pass.
- [ ] CodeQL and OpenSSF Scorecard findings are triaged.

## Publication

- [ ] PyPI project ownership and the GitHub `pypi` environment are confirmed.
- [ ] Trusted Publishing identity is scoped to `release.yml` and the `pypi` environment.
- [ ] Release workflow dry-run passes.
- [ ] The signed, protected version tag starts the release workflow.
- [ ] GitHub Release prerelease status matches the package development-status classifier.
- [ ] PyPI files, SHA-256 checksums, provenance attestations, and the GitHub Release describe the same artifacts.
- [ ] The automated public-endpoint wait and clean `pipx install`, `--version`, `doctor`, and `smoke-test` matrix pass after publication.
- [ ] The 60–90 second terminal cast and accessible transcript validate against the exact public version without private paths or fabricated output.

Check a box only after its evidence exists for this target version. Put final links and exact run IDs in the GitHub Release as well; leave blocked checks open with a reason.
